# flashdreams test runners

Three entrypoints for running the flashdreams test suite. Pick the one that matches your dev setup.

| Script | Audience | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`run_tests_local.sh`](./run_tests_local.sh) | dev already inside a container with deps installed | Just discovers tests and runs `pytest`. No install, no container. |
| [`run_tests_docker.sh`](./run_tests_docker.sh) | local machine with GPU + docker | `docker run` → install deps → run `pytest`. |
| [`run_tests_slurm.sh`](./run_tests_slurm.sh) | login node without GPU | `srun --container-image=…` (Pyxis/enroot) → install deps → run `pytest`. Requires `--partition`, `--account`. |

All three scripts resolve paths relative to their own location and can be invoked from anywhere.

`run_tests_docker` and `run_tests_slurm` dispatch internally (after establishing the environment) to `run_tests_local`.

## Quick examples

```bash
# Already inside a dev container (your venv has flashdreams[dev] + integrations)
./tests/run_tests_local.sh
./tests/run_tests_local.sh flashdreams/tests/test_attention.py

# Local machine with docker + GPU
./tests/run_tests_docker.sh
./tests/run_tests_docker.sh flashdreams/tests/test_attention.py

# Slurm (Pyxis/enroot) from a login node
./tests/run_tests_slurm.sh --partition batch --account nvr_torontoai_videogen --gpus 4
./tests/run_tests_slurm.sh --partition batch --account nvr_torontoai_videogen \
    --qos interactive --gpus 4 --cpus-per-gpu 36 --time 02:00:00 \
    -- flashdreams/tests/test_attention.py
```

## What gets run

When no `TEST_TARGET` is given, every script performs global discovery of `**/test_*.py`:

Pytest is invoked with `-m "not manual"` so any test marked `@pytest.mark.manual`
is skipped.

## Omnidreams quality regression

`integrations/omnidreams/tests/test_quality_regression.py` is the golden-clip
gate for generated driving video. It is marked `ci_gpu`, but skips until CI
provides the reference clip and deterministic input assets.

For PR gating, prefer a short clip: `TOTAL_BLOCKS=4` on the default chunk2
runner produces roughly one second at 30fps. A longer 5 second clip is better
as a nightly/manual check because it costs more GPU time and is more exposed to
small non-deterministic drift.

Minimum single-view setup:

```bash
export FLASHDREAMS_OMNIDREAMS_QUALITY_REFERENCE_CLIP=/abs/path/reference.mp4
export FLASHDREAMS_OMNIDREAMS_QUALITY_HDMAP_VIDEO_PATHS=/abs/path/hdmap.mp4
export FLASHDREAMS_OMNIDREAMS_QUALITY_FIRST_FRAME_PATHS=/abs/path/first_frame.png
uv run pytest integrations/omnidreams/tests/test_quality_regression.py -v
```

To use the runner's public single-view example data instead of supplying
`HDMAP_VIDEO_PATHS` and `FIRST_FRAME_PATHS`, set:

```bash
export FLASHDREAMS_OMNIDREAMS_QUALITY_EXAMPLE_DATA=1
```

The default example UUID is `239560dc-33d1-11ef-9720-00044bcbccac`; override it
with `FLASHDREAMS_OMNIDREAMS_QUALITY_EXAMPLE_DATA_UUID=<uuid>` if you want a
different sample from `nvidia/omni-dreams-samples`.

By default, the candidate MP4 is treated as the normal Omnidreams runner output:
HDMap condition stacked above generated frames. The test extracts the generated
lower half before comparison. The reference should normally be generated frames
only; if you promote the full runner MP4 as the reference, also set
`FLASHDREAMS_OMNIDREAMS_QUALITY_EXTRACT_GENERATED_REGION_FROM_REFERENCE=1`.
Set `FLASHDREAMS_OMNIDREAMS_QUALITY_ARTIFACT_DIR=/abs/path/artifacts` to copy
the original reference/candidate MP4s and the exact comparison-region MP4s to a
stable directory for visual inspection.

If prompt/image embeddings have been precomputed, set
`FLASHDREAMS_OMNIDREAMS_QUALITY_EMBEDDINGS_PATH=/abs/path/embeddings.pt` instead
of `FIRST_FRAME_PATHS`; the test then skips loading the one-shot text/image
encoders. Tune the metric gates with `MAX_MEAN_ABS`, `MAX_RMSE`,
`MIN_PSNR_DB`, `MAX_MEAN_FLIP`, and `MAX_FRAME_FLIP`. Refresh the reference by
running the same config, inspecting the generated MP4, and promoting it to the
reference location.

## Shared environment knobs

`run_tests_docker.sh` and `run_tests_slurm.sh` both read these env vars
(`run_tests_local.sh` ignores them — it doesn't manage caches or images):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FLASHDREAMS_TEST_IMAGE` | `nvidia/cuda:13.2.1-cudnn-devel-ubuntu24.04` | Container image used for the run. System deps and uv are installed at container start. |
| `FLASHDREAMS_UV_CACHE_DIR` | `${HOME}/.cache/uv` | Host dir mounted to `/root/.cache/uv`. |
| `FLASHDREAMS_HF_CACHE_DIR` | `${HOME}/.cache/huggingface` | Host dir mounted to `/root/.cache/huggingface`. |
| `FLASHDREAMS_CACHE_DIR` | `${HOME}/.cache/flashdreams` | Host dir mounted to `/root/.cache/flashdreams`. |
| `FLASHDREAMS_TRITON_CACHE_DIR` | `${HOME}/.cache/triton` | Host dir mounted to `/root/.cache/triton`; persisted across runs to avoid recompiling Triton kernels (also exported as `TRITON_CACHE_DIR`). |

Each script also has its own `--help` (slurm) or top-of-file usage block
(docker / in-container) for the full set of CLI flags.

## Container image caching (slurm only)

`run_tests_slurm.sh` does a one-time `enroot import` on the login node and
stores the resulting `.sqsh` under `${FLASHDREAMSIMAGE_CACHE_DIR}` (defaults to
`${HOME}/.cache/flashdreams/containers`). Subsequent runs pass that local file
straight to `--container-image=...`, so they skip the multi-minute
docker→sqsh conversion that pyxis would otherwise repeat inside every job.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FLASHDREAMSIMAGE_CACHE_DIR` | `${FLASHDREAMS_CACHE_DIR}/containers` | Where cached `.sqsh` files live. |

To force a re-import (e.g. after the upstream tag is re-pushed):

```bash
./tests/run_tests_slurm.sh --rebuild-image --partition batch --account <ACCT> --gpus 8
# or just delete the file:
rm "${HOME}/.cache/flashdreams/containers/nvcr.io_nvidia_pytorch_26.02-py3.sqsh"
```

If `enroot` isn't on the login node's PATH, the script falls back to letting
pyxis do its own import inside the srun job (and prints a warning).
