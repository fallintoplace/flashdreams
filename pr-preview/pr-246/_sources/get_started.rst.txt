Get Started
===========

This page covers the path from a fresh checkout of the repository to a
generated clip on a single CUDA-capable GPU.

Install
-------

FlashDreams uses the ``uv`` python package manager. Installation
instructions for ``uv`` are available in the `Astral documentation
<https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/>`_.

With ``uv`` installed, clone the repository and synchronise the workspace
environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/flashdreams.git
   cd flashdreams
   uv sync --extra dev --extra runners

Library-only install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For projects that consume FlashDreams as a dependency rather than
running the shipped recipes, install from PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install flashdreams

Or the current ``main`` branch:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install "git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/flashdreams.git"

Hugging Face authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most checkpoints download from Hugging Face on first run. Export an
access token before launching:

.. code-block:: bash

   export HF_TOKEN=<your-hf-token>
   export HF_HOME=~/.cache/huggingface  # optional cache location override

Speeding up CUDA builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first synchronisation compiles CUDA extensions from source, which
can be slow. Restricting compilation to the local GPU architecture and
parallelising build jobs reduces wall time substantially:

.. code-block:: bash

   CUDA_ARCH=$(nvidia-smi --query-gpu=compute_cap --format=csv,noheader | head -1 | tr -d '.')
   export NVTE_CUDA_ARCHS="${CUDA_ARCH}"
   export BLOCK_SPARSE_ATTN_CUDA_ARCHS="${CUDA_ARCH}"
   export MAX_JOBS=8

The `Contributing Guide
<https://github.com/NVIDIA/flashdreams/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#speeding-up-local-builds>`_
documents each variable in full and recommends an ``.envrc`` setup.

Run your first model
--------------------

Two reference paths cover the two primary usage modes: offline long
rollouts and interactive serving.

Offline inference with Self-Forcing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Launch an offline streaming run against the
:doc:`Self-Forcing </models/self_forcing>` Wan 2.1 1.3B T2V recipe with
the TAEHV decoder:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --project integrations/self_forcing \
       flashdreams-run self-forcing-wan2.1-t2v-1.3b-taehv \
       --total-blocks 7

The first invocation downloads checkpoints from Hugging Face into
``HF_HOME``. Subsequent runs reuse the local cache.

Interactive serving with LingBot-World
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Launch the :doc:`LingBot-World </models/lingbot_world>` camera-controlled
I2V recipe with the bundled example data:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --project integrations/lingbot \
       flashdreams-run lingbot-world-fast \
       --example-data True \
       --total-blocks 21

Where to next
-------------

- :doc:`/models/index` — every shipped recipe with its CLI slug,
  checkpoint source, and per-recipe knobs, alongside the benchmark
  numbers.
- :doc:`/developer_guides/inference_pipeline_overview` — the generation
  loop end to end: KV cache, ring attention, CUDA-graph capture.
- :doc:`/developer_guides/config_system` — the configuration layer
  every recipe shares.
- :doc:`/developer_guides/new_integration` — adding a new model or
  method as a plugin.
- :doc:`/api/index` — Python API and CLI reference.
- :doc:`/models/index` — steady-state per-step latency numbers
  with reproducer commands.
