      Measurement, not marketing

   .. rubric:: How fast is FlashDreams, really?
      :class: fd-hero-title

   .. container:: fd-hero-lede

      FlashDreams is built for **steady-state streaming video
      diffusion** — the interesting numbers are not "time to first
      frame" but the cost of every subsequent autoregressive step
      once KV caches are warm, CUDA graphs are captured, and the
      pipeline is in its hot loop. This page documents what we
      measure, on what hardware, with what software, and how
      FlashDreams compares to upstream baselines.

         .. container:: fd-stat-note

            Ring attention, bidirectional reference.

.. admonition:: PLACEHOLDER — headline stat values
   :class: placeholder

   **What goes here:** four ≤ 6-character stat values for the grid
   above. Pick the four that read best on the landing-page tile too.

   **Source data:** rows of the Results tables below; do not invent.

   **Reproduce with:** the per-row CLI invocations in *Methodology*.

.. admonition:: New to streaming inference?
   :class: fd-callout

   Start with :doc:`/index` for an overview, then walk a recipe in the
   :doc:`/quickstart/index` before reading these numbers in context.
   The architectural rationale lives in the :doc:`/api/index`.

What these benchmarks measure
-----------------------------

.. container:: fd-eyebrow

   Scope and metrics

.. container:: fd-lede

   Per-recipe, we report four numbers. Quality metrics (FVD, CLIP-T)
   are tracked by each recipe's training pipeline and are **out of
   scope** here — we only verify that the inference path is bit-for-
   bit (or tolerance-bounded) parity with the upstream reference.
   Parity status is noted per recipe.

.. grid:: 1 2 2 2
   :gutter: 3

   .. grid-item-card:: Steady-state step latency
      :class-card: fd-feature

      Wall-clock of one AR step (``diffuse`` + ``decode`` +
      ``finalize``) once past AR step 2 and the CUDA graph is
      captured. p50 and p95 of the steady window.

   .. grid-item-card:: Throughput
      :class-card: fd-feature

      Frames per second once steady; for bidirectional recipes,
      total frames / total wall-clock for one full generation.

   .. grid-item-card:: Peak GPU memory
      :class-card: fd-feature

      ``torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated`` in GiB, plus reserved
      memory for fragmentation analysis.

   .. grid-item-card:: Scaling efficiency
      :class-card: fd-feature

      Multi-GPU throughput as a fraction of the ideal linear scaling
      baseline; reported with the ring-attention topology used.

Methodology
-----------

.. container:: fd-eyebrow

   Four templates, every row reproducible

.. container:: fd-split fd-split-asymmetric-reverse

   .. container:: fd-split-text

      Every Results row is generated by one of the four invocations
      below. We do not report mean — single-step JIT / allocator
      outliers skew it. All step-latency numbers are the **median over
      five repeat runs** of the AR-2-onward window. p95 is reported
      alongside p50 only when the spread is informative (> 5 % of p50).

      **1. Single-GPU per-step latency.** Drive a recipe end-to-end
      through ``flashdreams-run``, parse the per-step log lines, drop
      the first two AR steps as warm-up, then take the median and 95th
      percentile of the remaining ``total(w/o finalize)`` values.

      .. code-block:: bash

         uv run flashdreams-run \
             self-forcing-wan2.1-t2v-1.3b-flash \
             --total-blocks 7 \
             2>&1 | tee /tmp/bench-self-forcing.log

      **2. Throughput.** Same invocation; take steady-state window as
      ``total − warmup`` and divide generated frame count by it.

      .. code-block:: bash

         uv run flashdreams-run \
             <streaming-recipe-slug> --total-blocks <N> \
             --output-dir /tmp/bench-frames

      ``--total-blocks`` is defined on streaming-runner subclasses
      (``self_forcing``, ``causal_forcing``,
      ``fastvideo_causal_wan22``, ``lingbot``, ``omnidreams``);
      bidirectional and non-streaming runners (``wan21-*``,
      ``cosmos2-*``) drop the flag and emit a single end-to-end
      output.

      **3. Multi-GPU / ring-attention scaling.** Launch with
      ``torchrun``; the recipe transformer auto-detects its
      context-parallel size from ``torchrun``'s ``WORLD`` group (no
      ``--ring-size`` flag — the launcher is the source of truth).
      Sweep world size 1 → 2 → 4 → 8.

      .. code-block:: bash

         uv run torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 --no-python \
             flashdreams-run wan21-t2v-1.3b-480p

      **4. Upstream-baseline parity.** Same recipe, same model
      checkpoint, under the upstream library's own environment. Feeds
      the *Versus upstream* section.

      .. code-block:: bash

         # See PERFORMANCE.md for the upstream env setup.
         PYTHONPATH=./flashdreams python -m flashdreams.scripts.cli \
             self-forcing-wan2.1-t2v-1.3b-flash --total-blocks 7

   .. container:: fd-split-visual

      .. container:: fd-info-card

         .. container:: fd-info-card-title

            What we time

         | AR step 2 onward (warm-up dropped)
         | ``total(w/o finalize)`` per step
         | Median of 5 repeat runs
         | p95 reported when spread > 5 %

         .. container:: fd-info-card-title

            What we do **not** report

         | Mean (allocator outliers skew it)
         | Time-to-first-frame
         | Quality metrics (FVD, CLIP-T)

         .. container:: fd-info-card-title

            Reproducibility

         | Every row → one CLI template above
         | Stdout is the source of truth
         | Hand-aggregated until the
         | harness lands

      .. admonition:: PLACEHOLDER — measurement harness
         :class: placeholder

         **What goes here:** wrapper script(s) under
         ``scripts/benchmarks/`` that parse logs into the CSVs that
         back the Results tables. Until that lands, every row is
         hand-computed from the recipe's stdout.

Charts
------

.. container:: fd-eyebrow

   Sweeps, not single points

.. container:: fd-lede

   Three charts ship alongside the tables once the sweep harness
   lands. Until then, each placeholder below names the CSV the chart
   will be drawn from and the methodology row it backs.

.. container:: fd-media-rail

         **Source CSV:** ``scripts/benchmarks/resolution_sweep.py``
         (TBD). **Reproduce with:** *Methodology* CLI #1 with the
         resolution flag varied per-recipe.

Versus upstream
---------------

.. container:: fd-eyebrow

   Same recipe, same GPU, different runner

.. container:: fd-lede

   The FlashDreams runner calls the same model code paths as the
   upstream library it integrates with, but in a different inference
   environment: KV caches managed by ``flashdreams.infra``, ring
   attention provided by ``flashdreams.core``, CUDA graph captured
   per recipe. Lower is better.

.. container:: fd-compare fd-compare-numeric

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 30 16 18 18 18

      * - Recipe (runner slug)

        - —

.. admonition:: PLACEHOLDER — upstream comparison values
   :class: placeholder

   **What goes here:** fill ``FlashDreams p50`` from the *Results —
   autoregressive* table above; collect ``Upstream p50`` by running
   *Methodology* CLI #4 in the upstream env; ``Ratio`` = upstream /
   FlashDreams.

   **Source data:** seed numbers for ``self-forcing`` exist in
   `PERFORMANCE.md
   <https://github.com/NVIDIA/flashdreams/blob/main/PERFORMANCE.md>`_;
   other rows are TBD.

   **Reproduce with:** *Methodology* CLI #4 paired with #1 on the same
   GPU + driver.

.. admonition:: A note on parity
   :class: fd-callout

   Three integrations currently ship a parity test against their
   upstream reference: ``self_forcing``, ``cosmos_predict2``, and
   ``lingbot`` (each has a ``tests/parity_check/run.sh`` intended for
   manual execution in the upstream env, not in CI). Other recipes
   ship smoke tests only. The numbers on this page assume parity
   holds where it's enforced; see :doc:`../community/index` for how
   to escalate a regression.

How we got here
---------------

.. container:: fd-eyebrow

   Pointers into the rest of the project

.. container:: fd-lede

   The point of this page is *what* — *why* lives elsewhere.

- The :doc:`/api/index` orients you to the four library surfaces and
  links to the design notes for ring attention, KV-cache management,
  and CUDA-graph capture of the steady-state forward.
- The :doc:`/developer_guides/index` cover the architectural concerns
  behind the recipes you can run today; *interactive serving* and
  *new recipes* are the shortest paths to a reproducible local
  measurement of your own.
- `PERFORMANCE.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/flashdreams/blob/main/PERFORMANCE.md>`_
  is the rolling perf narrative: it carries the raw stdout from the
  three GPUs we've profiled so far, before the numbers were
  aggregated into this page.
- :doc:`../community/index` lists the channels to use if a number on
  this page does not reproduce on your hardware — please file an
  issue rather than averaging away a discrepancy.
