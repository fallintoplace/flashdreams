FAQ
===

Answers to questions that come up repeatedly in issues, Discord, and
Discussions. If you don't see your question here, check :doc:`support`
for where to ask.

Getting started
---------------

What hardware do I need to run FlashDreams?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. admonition:: PLACEHOLDER — supported hardware answer
   :class: placeholder

   **What goes here:** A short statement of the minimum and
   recommended GPU configurations for inference and for training /
   fine-tuning, with pointers into the :doc:`benchmarks
   </benchmarks/index>` section for concrete numbers. Mention which
   compute capabilities are tested.


Which model recipes ship in the box?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. admonition:: PLACEHOLDER — recipe list
   :class: placeholder

   **What goes here:** A concise list with one-line descriptions of
   each shipped recipe (causal-forcing, self-forcing, wan21,
   omnidreams, lingbot-world, fastvideo causal wan22, …) and a link
   into the corresponding model page. Keep in sync with the
   *Supported models* grid on the landing page.


Installation and packaging
--------------------------

Why can I install ``flashdreams`` from PyPI but not the integration packages?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. admonition:: PLACEHOLDER — packaging answer
   :class: placeholder

   **What goes here:** A short explanation that only the core
   ``flashdreams`` package is published as a wheel; integrations are
   git-installable from the monorepo (with a ``pip install
   "flashdreams-<recipe> @ git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/flashdreams.git#subdirectory=integrations/<recipe>"``
   example). Cross-link to ``DEV.md`` for the rationale.


Usage
-----

How do I plug in a new model recipe?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. admonition:: PLACEHOLDER — new-recipe pointer
   :class: placeholder

   **What goes here:** A one-paragraph orientation followed by a link
   to the developer guide at
   :doc:`/developer_guides/new_integration`. Mention the smallest
   set of abstractions a recipe must implement to plug into
   ``flashdreams-run``.


Project and licensing
---------------------

Is FlashDreams the same project as Cosmos / NeMo / NIM?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. admonition:: PLACEHOLDER — relationship to other NVIDIA stacks
   :class: placeholder

   **What goes here:** A short, honest answer describing how
   FlashDreams relates to (or doesn't relate to) other NVIDIA video /
   generative stacks. If there are integration points or shared
   components, name them and link out.


Can I use FlashDreams commercially?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes. FlashDreams is released under the
`Apache License 2.0 <https://github.com/NVIDIA/flashdreams/blob/main/LICENSE>`__,
which permits commercial use, modification, and distribution under the
license's terms. Third-party model weights and datasets used with
FlashDreams may carry their own licenses — please check those
separately.

Contributing back is welcome but not required. See
:doc:`contributing` if you'd like to upstream a fix or improvement.
