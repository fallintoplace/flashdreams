Developer Guides
================

These guides cover how the system is structured underneath the CLI:
the inference pipeline a recipe runs through, the configuration layer
every recipe shares, the integration surface for adding a new method,
common patterns for driving the pipeline from Python, and the shape
of an interactive serving session. They are conceptual; the
:doc:`/api/index` is the per-symbol reference.

The pipeline overview is the anchor for the rest. The config system
is the layer every recipe shares; new integrations sit on top of
both. Usage patterns and interactive serving describe how the
pipeline is embedded in surrounding code.

   .. grid-item-card:: Inference pipeline overview
      :link: inference_pipeline_overview
      :link-type: doc

      The end-to-end computation flow: warmup, CUDA-graph capture,
      the autoregressive-step body, the ring-attention shard group,
      and finalize. The mental model the rest of the project assumes.

   .. grid-item-card:: Config system
      :link: config_system
      :link-type: doc

      How every overridable field is surfaced as a CLI flag, how
      recipe defaults compose, and how to layer overrides on top.

   .. grid-item-card:: Add a new method
      :link: new_integration
      :link-type: doc

      The entry-point surface a new recipe ships against: what to
      subclass, what to register, and where the parity tests live.

   .. grid-item-card:: Usage patterns
      :link: usage_patterns
      :link-type: doc

      Common ways to drive FlashDreams from Python: the CLI, the
      in-process runner API, and the pipeline-level surface for
      embedding.

   .. grid-item-card:: Interactive serving
      :link: interactive_serving
      :link-type: doc

      Keeping a streaming session alive: warmup, steady-state
      generation, and how the WebRTC and gRPC servers under
      ``integrations/`` wire the pipeline up.

Where these guides fit
----------------------

Working forward from a recipe, start with the pipeline overview,
then read the recipe's per-model page under :doc:`/benchmarks/index`,
then drop into the matching module under :doc:`/api/index` for the
implementation details. The :doc:`/quickstart/index` covers the
two-command path from install to a generated clip.
