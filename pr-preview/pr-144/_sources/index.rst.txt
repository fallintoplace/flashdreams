      .. container:: fd-split-visual

         .. admonition:: PLACEHOLDER — hero loop
            :class: placeholder

            **What goes here:** A short looping clip of a streaming
            recipe (for example ``self-forcing-wan2.1-t2v-1.3b-taehv``)
            generating end-to-end, or a stylised diagram of the
            KV cache / ring attention / CUDA-graph pipeline.

            **Format:** ``_static/hero-loop.avif`` (animated AVIF, 16:9).

Why FlashDreams
---------------

.. container:: fd-split fd-split-asymmetric

   .. container:: fd-split-text

      FlashDreams is built for the case where a diffusion video model has to
      respond in real time — a closed-loop world-model demo, a driving
      simulator, an interactive scene rollout. The optimisations needed for
      that case are different from those used by an offline, one-shot video
      generator, and FlashDreams organises them into three abstractions that
      every shipped recipe uses.

      **KV-cached transformers.** Each autoregressive chunk re-uses prior
      context as a KV cache instead of recomputing it. Self-forcing and
      causal-forcing training regimes are first-class.

      **Ring attention.** Context-parallel attention across ranks, so
      long-horizon generation scales out instead of OOM-ing on a single GPU.

      **CUDA-graph capture.** The steady-state forward is captured into a
      CUDA graph after warmup, collapsing Python and launch overhead in the
      hot loop.

      The library is Apache-2.0 and developed in the open. The internals are
      covered in the :doc:`documentation <documentation/index>`.

   .. container:: fd-split-visual

      .. admonition:: PLACEHOLDER — architecture diagram
         :class: placeholder

         Stacked-block diagram showing the three abstractions in the
         hot loop: KV cache, ring attention, and CUDA-graph capture.
         Saved as ``_static/arch-diagram.svg`` (light and dark
         variants).

Performance
-----------

Each tile shows per-step latency at steady state — post-warmup,
post-graph-capture — measured against the upstream library's own
runner on the same hardware and the same checkpoint. Full methodology
lives on the :doc:`benchmarks page <benchmarks/index>`.

Try FlashDreams
---------------

The :doc:`Get Started guide <quickstart/index>` walks from a fresh
checkout to a generated frame on a single GPU.

Supported models
----------------

Streaming and autoregressive recipes emit per-step output with
sub-second latency once warm; bidirectional recipes are kept as
full-block parity references. Each model page carries the canonical
invocation, the checkpoint source, and the per-recipe knobs.
