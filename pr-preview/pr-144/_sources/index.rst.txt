            FlashDreams is NVIDIA's streaming inference stack for diffusion-based
            video and interactive world models — the runtime backbone of the
            `OmniDreams closed-loop demo at GTC 2026
            <https://research.nvidia.com/labs/sil/projects/omnidreams-blog/>`_.
            KV-cached transformers, ring attention, and CUDA-graph capture,
            behind one ``flashdreams-run`` CLI. Built for real-time applications
            across gaming, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and virtual
            environments — eight integrated model recipes, sub-second
            autoregressive steps after warmup.

            :class: placeholder

            **What goes here:** A looping 5–10s clip of one of the streaming
            recipes (e.g. ``self-forcing-wan2.1-t2v-1.3b-flash``) running
            end-to-end, or a stylised architecture illustration of the
            KV cache + ring attention + CUDA-graph pipeline.

            **Format:** ``_static/hero-loop.mp4`` (16:9, < 4 MB, autoplay
            muted loop) or a static ``_static/hero-illustration.svg``.

Why FlashDreams
---------------

.. container:: fd-eyebrow

   Designed for streaming, not retrofitted

.. container:: fd-split fd-split-asymmetric

   .. container:: fd-split-text

      Diffusion video generators are getting fast enough to be
      interactive — but only if the inference stack is built for it.
      FlashDreams is organised around three sharp abstractions that every
      shipped recipe plugs into.

      **KV-cached transformers.** Each autoregressive chunk re-uses prior
      context as a KV cache instead of recomputing it. Self-forcing and
      causal-forcing training regimes are first-class.

      **Ring attention.** Context-parallel attention across ranks.
      Long-horizon generation scales out instead of OOM-ing on a
      single GPU.

      **CUDA-graph capture.** The steady-state forward is captured into a
      CUDA graph after warmup, collapsing Python and launch overhead in
      the hot loop.

   .. container:: fd-split-visual

      .. admonition:: PLACEHOLDER — architecture diagram
         :class: placeholder

         Stacked-block diagram showing the three abstractions in the
         hot loop: KV cache → ring attention → CUDA-graph capture.
         Saved as ``_static/arch-diagram.svg`` (light and dark
         variants).

The result is the per-step latency in the :doc:`benchmarks
<benchmarks/index>` table — sub-second per autoregressive chunk on H100
/ GB200 once the pipeline is warm.

         5–10s looping clip of ``self-forcing-wan2.1-t2v-1.3b-flash``
         generating from a held-out prompt. Side-by-side with the
         FastVideo baseline so the wall-clock difference reads
         visually.

         :class: placeholder

         5–10s looping clip of the causal-forcing I2V recipe driving

         from a single first-frame condition.

What's inside
-------------

.. container:: fd-eyebrow

   Library surface

.. container:: fd-lede

   FlashDreams ships as one ``uv``-managed workspace: a core library, an
   infra layer, plugin-friendly recipe registry, and a single CLI front
   door for every shipped model.

.. grid:: 1 1 2 2
   :gutter: 3

   .. grid-item-card:: Unified ``flashdreams-run`` CLI
      :class-card: fd-feature fd-feature-hero
      :columns: 12 12 6 6
      :link: api/cli
      :link-type: doc

      One console script dispatches over every in-tree and plugin
      recipe. Every overridable field is a CLI flag; ``--help`` lists
      every registered runner. New recipes auto-register through
      entry points — no central manifest to keep in sync.

   .. grid-item-card:: Multi-GPU by default
      :class-card: fd-feature
      :columns: 12 12 6 2
      :link: api/infra
      :link-type: doc

      Recipes auto-detect CP size from ``torch.distributed``'s world
      group. The launcher is the single source of truth.

   .. grid-item-card:: Plugin-friendly recipes
      :class-card: fd-feature
      :columns: 12 12 6 2
      :link: developer_guides/new_integration
      :link-type: doc

      Recipes can ship in-tree or as out-of-tree plugins, discovered
      through entry points. Self-Forcing and Causal-Forcing ship as
      workspace-member packages under ``integrations/``.

   .. grid-item-card:: Mockable for CI
      :class-card: fd-feature
      :columns: 12 12 6 2
      :link: developer_guides/inference_pipeline_overview
      :link-type: doc

      Heaviest C-extensions (transformer-engine, triton, pynvml) are
      mocked at autodoc time so docs build on CPU-only hosts.

Supported models
----------------

.. container:: fd-eyebrow

   Eight recipes, one CLI

.. container:: fd-lede

   Each model below has a walkthrough with the exact
   ``flashdreams-run`` slug, the checkpoint source, and any per-recipe
   knobs. Streaming / autoregressive variants are KV-cached and emit
   per-AR-step output; bidirectional variants are the single
   full-block reference.

      Bidirectional reference model used for parity testing — T2V
      1.3B / 480p and I2V 14B / 480p.

How it compares
---------------

.. container:: fd-eyebrow

   Same recipe, same hardware

.. container:: fd-split fd-split-reverse

   .. container:: fd-split-text

      We rebuild the upstream library's own runner on identical
      hardware, then run FlashDreams against the same checkpoint and
      sampling configuration. The delta is wall-clock at steady
      state — post warmup, post graph capture, post first-iteration
      JIT compilation. Numbers update with the rolling ``main`` branch
      whenever a recipe lands a perf change.

      Full methodology — hardware, software pin, sampling knobs,
      what gets timed — lives on the :doc:`benchmarks page
      <benchmarks/index>`.

   .. container:: fd-split-visual

      .. admonition:: PLACEHOLDER — comparison still
         :class: placeholder

         Side-by-side still frame: FlashDreams output (left) vs
         upstream baseline output (right), same prompt, same seed.
         Overlaid wall-clock readout in the bottom-right corner.

Quick start
-----------

.. container:: fd-eyebrow

   Two commands to a generated video

.. container:: fd-split fd-split-asymmetric

   .. container:: fd-split-text

      FlashDreams is a `uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>`_ workspace. The
      CLI lazy-imports ``mediapy`` + ``opencv`` for I/O, so install the
      ``runners`` extra whenever you want to actually generate video.

      The :doc:`quickstart/index` has the annotated quickstart, an
      end-to-end first-generation walkthrough, and pointers into the
      developer guides for CUDA-graph capture, distributed launching,
      and authoring a custom recipe.

      .. admonition:: New to streaming diffusion?
         :class: fd-callout

         Read the :doc:`inference pipeline overview
         </developer_guides/inference_pipeline_overview>` before
         tweaking recipes — it walks the hot loop a recipe goes
         through, end to end.

   .. container:: fd-split-visual

      .. code-block:: bash

         uv sync --extra dev --extra runners
