Models

.. container:: fd-hero fd-hero-band

   .. container:: fd-hero-eyebrow

      Eight recipes, one CLI

   .. rubric:: Every shipped model. Same ``flashdreams-run`` front door.
      :class: fd-hero-title

   .. container:: fd-hero-lede

      FlashDreams ships streaming / autoregressive recipes (KV-cached,
      per-AR-step output) and bidirectional reference recipes
      (single full-block reference, used for parity). Each model
      page has the exact CLI slug, the checkpoint source, and the
      per-recipe knobs.

Running a model
---------------

.. container:: fd-eyebrow

   The CLI is the only entry point

.. container:: fd-split fd-split-asymmetric

   .. container:: fd-split-text

      Every recipe is a named slug. ``flashdreams-run --help`` lists
      every registered runner and every overridable field is a flag.
      Streaming runners take ``--total-blocks`` to bound the AR-step
      count; bidirectional runners produce a single end-to-end
      output.

      Each model page below has the canonical invocation for that
      recipe — copy, paste, run.

   .. container:: fd-split-visual

      .. code-block:: bash

         # List every shipped recipe.
         uv run flashdreams-run --help

         # Streaming Wan 2.1 T2V (Self-Forcing plugin).
         uv run flashdreams-run \
             self-forcing-wan2.1-t2v-1.3b-flash \
             --total-blocks 7

         # Camera-controlled I2V with bundled example data.
         uv run flashdreams-run \
             lingbot-world-fast \
             --example-data True --total-blocks 21

Streaming / autoregressive
--------------------------

.. container:: fd-eyebrow

   KV-cached, per-AR-step output

.. container:: fd-lede

   Designed for interactive use — output emits as the pipeline
   advances, with sub-second steady-state step latency on H100 /
   GB200 once the CUDA graph is captured.

.. container:: fd-media-rail

   .. container:: fd-media-tile

      .. admonition:: PLACEHOLDER — Self-Forcing demo frame
         :class: placeholder

         Sample still from a Self-Forcing T2V generation.

   .. container:: fd-media-tile

      .. admonition:: PLACEHOLDER — Causal-Forcing demo frame
         :class: placeholder

         Sample still from a Causal-Forcing I2V run.

   .. container:: fd-media-tile

      .. admonition:: PLACEHOLDER — LingBot-World demo frame
         :class: placeholder

         Sample still from a LingBot-World camera-controlled I2V run.

.. grid:: 1 2 2 3
   :gutter: 3

   .. grid-item-card:: Self-Forcing
      :class-card: fd-feature
      :link: self_forcing
      :link-type: doc

      Streaming Wan 2.1 T2V via the Self-Forcing plugin. AR steps
      after warmup are sub-second on H100 / GB200.

   .. grid-item-card:: Causal-Forcing
      :class-card: fd-feature
      :link: causal_forcing
      :link-type: doc

      Causal-forcing framewise T2V and I2V variants of Wan 2.1 via
      the Causal-Forcing plugin.

   .. grid-item-card:: Causal Wan 2.2
      :class-card: fd-feature
      :link: causal_wan22
      :link-type: doc

      FastVideo Wan 2.2 14B causal T2V recipe.

   .. grid-item-card:: LingBot-World
      :class-card: fd-feature
      :link: lingbot_world
      :link-type: doc

      Camera-controlled I2V with bundled prompt + first-frame +
      camera arrays.

   .. grid-item-card:: OmniDreams
      :class-card: fd-feature
      :link: omnidreams
      :link-type: doc

      Single-view and multi-view streaming recipes against the
      OmniDreams checkpoints, including a diffusion-forcing AR
      variant.

   .. grid-item-card:: FlashVSR
      :class-card: fd-feature
      :link: flashvsr
      :link-type: doc

      Streaming video super-resolution recipe for the FlashVSR
      checkpoint family.

Bidirectional reference
-----------------------

.. container:: fd-eyebrow

   Single full-block reference

.. container:: fd-lede

   Used for parity testing against the streaming recipes above.
   These runners emit one end-to-end output per invocation rather
   than per-step.

.. grid:: 1 2 2 2
   :gutter: 3

   .. grid-item-card:: Wan 2.1
      :class-card: fd-feature
      :link: wan21
      :link-type: doc

      Bidirectional Wan 2.1 — T2V 1.3B / 480p and I2V 14B / 480p.
      The parity baseline for ``self-forcing`` and
      ``causal-forcing`` recipes.

   .. grid-item-card:: Cosmos-Predict2.5
      :class-card: fd-feature
      :link: cosmos_predict2
      :link-type: doc

      Bidirectional Cosmos-Predict2 recipes (T2V / I2V, 2B).

Adding your own model
---------------------

.. container:: fd-eyebrow

   The integration surface

.. container:: fd-split fd-split-reverse

   .. container:: fd-split-text

      Recipes ship in-tree under ``integrations/`` as workspace-member
      packages, or out-of-tree as third-party plugins discovered
      through entry points. The :doc:`integration guide
      </developer_guides/new_integration>` walks the full surface
      — what to subclass, what to register, where the parity test
      goes.

      The shipping recipes are the best reference: each
      ``integrations/<recipe>/`` directory carries the runner, the
      registration shim, and (where applicable) a
      ``tests/parity_check/`` script that runs the same generation
      under the upstream library.

            Integration checklist

         | 1. Subclass the appropriate runner base class.
         | 2. Register the recipe via the ``flashdreams.runners``
         |    entry point.
         | 3. Add a per-model page under ``docs/source/models/``.
         | 4. (Streaming) wire ``--total-blocks`` into the runner
         |    config.
         | 5. (Parity) ship a ``tests/parity_check/run.sh``.
